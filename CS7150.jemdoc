== Course Information
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that builds highly parameterized (deep) models from large volume of data, widely deployed in many industrial systems.
Applications cover computer vision, language, speech, robotics, etc. Deep learning advances so rapidly that it has become one of the most popular field to study.

This course will introduce students to

1) basic building blocks of deep models, e.g., convolution, activation functions, attention

2) typical architectures, e.g., encoder-decoder for seq-to-seq tasks

3) training and evaluation of these models, e.g., variants of stochastic optimizers

Some cutting edge research topics will also be discussed, e.g., interpretability, model compression, self-supervised pretraining. There will be a course project that encourages student to explore more of these open-ended problems.

General Policies:
- Attend regularly: If you cannot make it, please email TA. Note: 3+ absence without extenuating reason (e.g., illness, attending conferences) can harm your grade
- Academic integrity (check [https://osccr.sites.northeastern.edu/academic-integrity-policy/ here]): In your homework or final project,
	-- if you copied code somewhere from the web, please put a comment of the link
	-- if you discussed with others, please acknowledge your collaborator
	-- if you used chatgpt or any of its equivalence, please give details on how you prompted the language model.
